<h1 class="about-header">About</h1>
<p>From the beginning, twin sisters Jacqui & Angela have shared the same love for fashion. Finishing high school in 2013, the two set out to gain the skills to become web developmers and create an online fashion boutique. The goal is to make younger women feel empowered to look and feel good, whilst not damaging their pockets. As young, female entreprenuers, we aspire to achieve this to ensure that all females look and feel great!</p><br>
